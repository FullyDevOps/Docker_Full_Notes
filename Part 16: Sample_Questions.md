### 1. What is Docker and why is it used?

Docker is an open-source platform that allows developers to package applications and their dependencies into containers. Containers are lightweight, portable, and ensure consistency across different environments. This helps eliminate the "it works on my machine" problem. Docker improves speed, scalability, and efficiency in software development and deployment.

### 2. What is the difference between Docker and a Virtual Machine (VM)?

A virtual machine runs on a hypervisor and includes a full operating system, making it heavy in terms of resources. Docker containers, on the other hand, share the host OS kernel and are much lighter. This allows containers to start up quickly and use fewer resources. While VMs are best for strong isolation, containers are better for faster development and deployment cycles.

### 3. What is a Docker Image?

A Docker image is a read-only template that contains the application code, libraries, and dependencies needed to run a container. Images are built from instructions in a Dockerfile. They act as a blueprint for containers, ensuring consistency across environments. Once built, images can be stored in registries and reused to spin up multiple containers.

---

### 4. What is a Docker Container?

A Docker container is a running instance of a Docker image. It includes everything needed to execute an application, such as code, runtime, and libraries. Containers are isolated from each other but share the same operating system kernel. They can be started, stopped, and removed easily, making them ideal for scalable application deployment.

---

### 5. What is a Dockerfile?

A Dockerfile is a text file containing step-by-step instructions to build a Docker image. It includes commands to set a base image, copy application files, install dependencies, and define environment variables. Each instruction in the Dockerfile creates a new layer in the image. This approach helps maintain version control and ensures reproducibility in building images.

---

### 6. What is Docker Hub?

Docker Hub is a cloud-based registry where Docker images are stored, shared, and managed. It provides a large collection of pre-built images for popular applications, frameworks, and operating systems. Developers can push their own images to Docker Hub and share them publicly or privately. It plays a vital role in collaboration and reusability in containerized environments.

---

### 7. What are Docker Volumes?

Docker volumes are used to persist data generated and used by containers. Unlike the container’s writable layer, volumes are stored outside the container, making them more durable and reusable. They allow data to survive container restarts and removals. Volumes are commonly used for databases and applications that require permanent storage.

---

### 8. What is Docker Compose?

Docker Compose is a tool used to define and manage multi-container applications. It uses a YAML configuration file to specify services, networks, and volumes. With a single command, developers can bring up all required containers and manage them as one application. This is especially useful for complex applications like microservices.

---

### 9. What are Docker Networks?

Docker networks allow containers to communicate with each other and with external systems. By default, Docker provides bridge, host, and none networks. Networks help isolate containers while still allowing controlled communication when needed. This ensures security and flexibility in deploying multi-container applications.

---

### 10. What is the difference between COPY and ADD in Dockerfile?

Both COPY and ADD are Dockerfile instructions used to move files into an image. COPY is simple and used strictly for copying files and directories. ADD provides additional functionality, such as extracting compressed files and pulling files from URLs. Best practice is to use COPY for clarity unless ADD’s extra features are required.

---

### 11. What is the difference between a Docker Registry and a Repository?

A Docker Registry is a storage and distribution system for Docker images, while a Repository is a collection of related images. For example, Docker Hub is a registry, and within it, you can find repositories like `nginx` or `mysql`. Each repository can have multiple image versions identified by tags. This structure makes it easier to manage and distribute images.

---

### 12. What is the role of Docker Daemon?

The Docker Daemon is a background service responsible for managing Docker objects such as images, containers, networks, and volumes. It listens to Docker API requests and handles container lifecycle operations. The daemon interacts with the operating system kernel to create isolated environments. Without the daemon, Docker commands would not execute.

---

### 13. What is the difference between docker run and docker start?

`docker run` creates and starts a new container from an image, while `docker start` restarts an existing stopped container. When using `docker run`, you can specify configuration options like ports and environment variables. On the other hand, `docker start` uses the original settings from when the container was created. This distinction helps manage container lifecycles efficiently.

---

### 14. What is the purpose of tagging in Docker Images?

Tagging helps identify different versions of Docker images. By default, images are tagged as "latest," but custom tags allow developers to track versions such as `v1.0` or `v2.1`. This ensures clarity and control when deploying specific versions of an application. Tags are crucial for version management in production environments.

---

### 15. What are some advantages of using Docker?

Docker provides consistency across different environments, reducing deployment issues. It enables faster startup times compared to virtual machines. Containers are lightweight, portable, and scalable, making them ideal for microservices architectures. Additionally, Docker integrates well with CI/CD pipelines, improving automation and efficiency in software delivery.
