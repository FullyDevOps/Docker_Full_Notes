# **Part 12: Orchestration and Beyond**

> 🚀 Docker is powerful — but **single-host tools like `docker run` and `docker compose` don’t scale**.  
> This guide shows how to **orchestrate containers across multiple machines**, achieve high availability, and embrace modern deployment models like **serverless and edge computing**.

---

## 1. **When to Use Orchestration**

### 🔹 Scaling, High Availability, Multi-Host

You need orchestration when:

| Use Case | Why Orchestration? |
|--------|---------------------|
| **Scale to 100+ containers** | Manual management becomes impossible |
| **High availability required** | Auto-restart failed containers |
| **Deploy across multiple servers** | Coordinate workloads across hosts |
| **Zero-downtime deployments** | Rolling updates, canary releases |
| **Dynamic load balancing** | Route traffic to healthy instances |
| **Auto-healing** | Replace crashed containers automatically |

> ✅ Orchestration = **Self-managing, resilient, scalable systems**

---

### 🔹 Limitations of Single-Host Docker

Tools like `docker run` and `docker compose` are great for:
- Local development
- CI/CD test environments
- Small apps

But they **fail at scale**:

| Limitation | Impact |
|----------|--------|
| ❌ No multi-host support | Can’t span containers across machines |
| ❌ No auto-healing | Crashed containers stay down |
| ❌ No rolling updates | Manual `docker stop` + `start` |
| ❌ No built-in load balancing | Must add Nginx manually |
| ❌ No declarative state | No "desired state" reconciliation |
| ❌ No secrets management | Only in Swarm or external tools |
| ❌ No observability at scale | Hard to monitor 50 containers |

> 📌 **Rule of Thumb**:  
> - < 10 containers → Docker Compose  
> - > 10 containers or multi-host → **Orchestration required**

---

## 2. **Docker Swarm: Built-In Orchestration**

### 🔹 What is Docker Swarm?

**Docker Swarm** is Docker’s **native clustering and orchestration tool** — simple, lightweight, and tightly integrated.

- Part of Docker Engine (no extra install)
- Uses familiar Docker CLI (`docker service`, `docker stack`)
- Ideal for teams already using Docker

> ✅ "Docker all the way down" — simple learning curve.

---

### 🔹 Key Concepts

| Term | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Node** | A physical or virtual machine in the cluster |
| **Manager Node** | Controls the cluster (schedules services, maintains state) |
| **Worker Node** | Runs containers (services) |
| **Service** | A scalable, long-running task (e.g., "run 5 instances of nginx") |
| **Task** | A single container instance of a service |
| **Stack** | A group of services defined in a `docker-compose.yml` file |

---

### 🔹 Initialize a Swarm
```bash
docker swarm init --advertise-addr <MANAGER-IP>
```

Output:
```
To add a worker to this swarm, run:
    docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1... WORKER-IP:2377
```

Add workers:
```bash
docker swarm join --token <TOKEN> <MANAGER-IP>:2377
```

---

### 🔹 Deploy a Service
```bash
docker service create --name web --replicas 3 -p 80:80 nginx
```

- Creates 3 replicas of `nginx`
- Load-balanced across all nodes
- Auto-restarts if container fails

#### Scale:
```bash
docker service scale web=5
```

#### Update:
```bash
docker service update --image nginx:1.25 web
```

> ✅ Rolling update by default.

---

### 🔹 Stacks: Multi-Service Deployment

Use a `docker-compose.yml` to define a full app stack.

```yaml
# docker-stack.yml
version: '3.8'

services:
  web:
    image: myapp:1.0
    deploy:
      replicas: 3
      update_config:
        parallelism: 1
        delay: 10s
      rollback_config:
        parallelism: 1
      restart_policy:
        condition: on-failure
    ports:
      - "80:5000"

  db:
    image: postgres:15
    deploy:
      placement:
        constraints:
          - node.role == manager
    volumes:
      - db-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data

volumes:
  db-data:
```

Deploy:
```bash
docker stack deploy -c docker-stack.yml myapp
```

> ✅ One command → full production stack.

---

### 🔹 Rolling Updates and Rollbacks

Swarm supports **zero-downtime deployments**.

#### Configure Update Strategy:
```yaml
deploy:
  update_config:
    parallelism: 2        # Update 2 containers at a time
    delay: 10s            # Wait 10s between batches
    failure_action: rollback  # Roll back on failure
```

#### Trigger Update:
```bash
docker service update --image myapp:2.0 web
```

#### Manual Rollback:
```bash
docker service rollback web
```

> ✅ Safe, controlled deployments.

---

### 🔹 When to Use Docker Swarm

| ✅ Pros | ❌ Cons |
|-------|--------|
| Simple setup | Less feature-rich than Kubernetes |
| Native Docker CLI | Smaller ecosystem |
| Fast to deploy | Limited scalability (~1000 nodes) |
| Great for small/mid teams | Not cloud-provider standard |
| Built-in secrets, configs, rolling updates | Less community support |

> 📌 Best for: **small to mid-sized teams**, **on-prem**, **Docker-native shops**

---

## 3. **Kubernetes: The Industry Standard**

### 🔹 Why Kubernetes?

**Kubernetes (K8s)** is the **de facto standard** for container orchestration.

- Used by Google, Microsoft, AWS, Netflix, Spotify
- Runs 80%+ of production container workloads
- Extremely powerful and extensible

> ✅ If you're serious about containers, **you need to know Kubernetes**.

---

### 🔹 Key Concepts

| Term | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Pod** | Smallest unit — one or more containers that share network/IP |
| **Deployment** | Manages Pod replicas, rolling updates, rollbacks |
| **Service** | Stable network endpoint (load balancer) for Pods |
| **Namespace** | Logical isolation (e.g., dev, staging, prod) |
| **ConfigMap** | Inject configuration data |
| **Secret** | Inject sensitive data (base64-encoded) |
| **Ingress** | External HTTP(S) routing |
| **Helm** | Package manager for Kubernetes apps |

---

### 🔹 How Docker Fits into Kubernetes

> ❓ "But I thought Docker was replaced by containerd?"

**Clarification**:
- Docker Engine is **not used directly** in modern K8s
- Kubernetes uses **containerd** (Docker’s underlying runtime)
- Docker is still used for:
  - Building images (`Dockerfile`)
  - Local development (`minikube`, `kind`, `Docker Desktop`)
  - CI/CD pipelines

> ✅ **You still use Docker** — just not as the runtime in K8s clusters.

---

### 🔹 Example: Deploy to Kubernetes

#### 1. Build with Docker
```bash
docker build -t myapp:1.0 .
docker tag myapp:1.0 registry.com/myapp:1.0
docker push registry.com/myapp:1.0
```

#### 2. Define in Kubernetes YAML
```yaml
# deployment.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: web
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: web
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: web
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: web
        image: registry.com/myapp:1.0
        ports:
        - containerPort: 5000
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: web-svc
spec:
  selector:
    app: web
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 5000
  type: LoadBalancer
```

#### 3. Apply
```bash
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
```

> ✅ Done. App is running, load-balanced, scalable.

### 🔹 Kubernetes vs. Docker Swarm

| Feature | Kubernetes | Docker Swarm |
|--------|------------|--------------|
| Learning Curve | Steep | Gentle |
| Scalability | 5000+ nodes | ~1000 nodes |
| Ecosystem | Huge (Helm, Istio, Prometheus) | Small |
| CLI | `kubectl` (complex) | `docker service` (familiar) |
| Cloud Support | Native in AWS EKS, GCP GKE, Azure AKS | Limited |
| CI/CD Integration | Excellent | Good |
| Development Experience | Requires tools (minikube, kind) | Built into Docker Desktop |

> ✅ **Swarm**: Simplicity  
> ✅ **Kubernetes**: Power, scale, future-proofing

---

## 4. **Serverless and Edge Computing**

### 🔹 AWS Fargate, Azure Container Instances

Run containers **without managing servers**.

| Service | Provider | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| **AWS Fargate** | Amazon | Run containers on ECS or EKS without EC2 |
| **Azure Container Instances (ACI)** | Microsoft | Start containers in seconds |
| **Google Cloud Run** | Google | Serverless containers (Knative) |
| **Fly.io**, **Railway**, **Render** | Third-party | Developer-friendly platforms |

#### Example: AWS Fargate
```yaml
# ECS Task Definition (simplified)
containerDefinitions:
  - name: web
    image: myapp:1.0
    memory: 512
    cpu: 256
    portMappings:
      - containerPort: 80
```

Deploy → AWS manages infrastructure.

> ✅ Pay-per-use, auto-scaling, no patching.

---

### 🔹 IoT and Edge Deployments

Run containers on **low-power, remote devices**.

#### Use Cases:
- Smart cameras
- Industrial sensors
- Retail kiosks
- Autonomous vehicles

#### Tools:
- **K3s** (lightweight Kubernetes for edge)
- **Docker + Raspberry Pi**
- **AWS Greengrass**, **Azure IoT Edge**

#### Example: Raspberry Pi
```bash
curl -sSL https://get.docker.com | sh
docker run -d --restart=unless-stopped sensor-agent:latest
```

> ✅ Consistent software across thousands of devices.

---

## ✅ Summary: Choosing Your Path

| Scenario | Recommended Solution |
|--------|------------------------|
| Local dev, small apps | ✅ Docker Compose |
| On-prem, Docker-native team | ✅ Docker Swarm |
| Enterprise, cloud-native | ✅ Kubernetes |
| No infra management | ✅ AWS Fargate / Cloud Run |
| Edge/IoT devices | ✅ K3s or lightweight Docker |
| Fast prototyping | ✅ Docker Desktop + Compose |
| High-scale microservices | ✅ Kubernetes + Helm |

---

## 🚀 Pro Tips

1. **Start with Compose**, then move to Swarm or K8s as you scale.
2. **Use the same images** across environments — build once, promote.
3. **Automate deployment** with CI/CD (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI).
4. **Monitor everything** — Prometheus, Grafana, ELK.
5. **Secure your cluster** — RBAC, network policies, image scanning.
6. **Test rollback procedures** — they save you in outages.
7. **Use Helm or Kustomize** to manage complex K8s apps.
